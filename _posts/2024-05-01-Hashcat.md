This tool is used to decrypt hashes and has too many variants, check hashcat to know how hash works and which hash is.

## Identify Hash

To know how to decrypt the hash we have to identify how is compose, usually it can be **salt + hash** or **hash + salt**.

## Basic Hash

Decrypt basic MD5 hash:

```
First create a file with the hash.
CLI: echo "f4a3546c86b0c40da07c60038c4bab46" > hash
Use hashcat with type 0 (MD5) and dictionary (-a 0)
CLI: hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show
Prompt in terminal: f4a3546c86b0c40da07c60038c4bab46:This hash is MD5
```
